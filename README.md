# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis was created, through machine learning, to accurately predict credit risk. Credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem. Several different techniques were used to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The data set that was used came from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to use Resampling models, SMOTEENN Algorithm, Ensemble Classifiers to predict credit risk.
